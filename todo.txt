TODO:
- heartbeat mechanism
- drop sub2video (needs heartbeat)
- properly deal with -ss and -t (need strim filter?)
- sub_start_display/sub_end_display needs to be honored
- find a test case for dvbsub as it's likely broken (ffmpeg.c hack is
  removed and should be replaced by a EAGAIN logic in lavc/utils.c)
- make it pass FATE:
  * fix cc/subcc
  * broke various other stuff
- Changelog/APIchanges
- proper API doxy
- update lavfi/subtitles?
- merge [avs]null filters
- filters doc
- avcodec_default_get_buffer2?
- how to transfer subtitle header down to libavfilter?
